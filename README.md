CL-MEMCACHED
============

CL-MEMCACHED is a library to interface with the [memcached](http://www.danga.com/memcached/) object caching system.

According to the home page :
> *memcached* is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

>[Danga](http://www.danga.com/") Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of [LiveJournal](http://livejournal.com), a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers. memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the databases on a memcache miss.
